/**
 * @title GraphTokenLock
 * @notice Contract that manages an unlocking schedule of tokens.
 * @dev The contract lock manage a number of tokens deposited into the contract to ensure that
 * they can only be released under certain time conditions.
 *
 * This contract implements a release scheduled based on periods and tokens are released in steps
 * after each period ends. It can be configured with one period in which case it is like a plain TimeLock.
 * It also supports revocation to be used for vesting schedules.
 *
 * The contract supports receiving extra funds than the managed tokens ones that can be
 * withdrawn by the beneficiary at any time.
 *
 * A releaseStartTime parameter is included to override the default release schedule and
 * perform the first release on the configured time. After that it will continue with the
 * default schedule.
